Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

*   Use the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

*   The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

*   Presented with timeblocks for standard business hours view the timeblocks for that day.

*   Timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

*   Click into a timeblock then the user can enter an event.

*   Click the save button for that timeblock then the text for that event is saved in local storage.

*   User refresh the page then the saved events persist.
